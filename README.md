--->Music Mates is a group of three musicians who have been performing together for approximately two years. The group have regular repeat gigs around the North West of England, which provides enough funds for them to be paid as part-time professional musicians.  In addition to their musical talents, Alexander, Sergei, and Vassily, are experienced sound engineers, who provide a PA service for the Music Mates gigs and for a number of other bands in the North-West area. They share a wide network of friends who are also musicians and they often promote other bands. But recently these other bands have asked them to be agents for an agree fee. If they decide to take this professional route, it would mean that they could work full-time as musicians/agents.
